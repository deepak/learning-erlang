% not a valid function as variable name has to be capital
% error in erl REPL is `exception error: no function clause matching questions:foo(1)`

%% cannot have a module called lists as that is an Erlang module (evidently)
%% so would be nice if erlang had namespaces,
%% http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2007-September/028892.html
%% but for ex. Ruby does not have them and it does just fine :-)
%% compiling such a module gives an error: "Can't load module 'lists' that resides in sticky dir"
%% check by `code:which(lists).` which gives
%% "/usr/local/Cellar/erlang/19.2.3/lib/erlang/lib/stdlib-3.2/ebin/lists.beam"
%% cannot have a method called `max` in a module as well, as that is an Erlang function (BIF)
